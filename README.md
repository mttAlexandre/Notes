# Notes App

Demo iOS 16 SwiftUI app.  
The goal is the build a Microsoft OneNote like app from scratch for iOS 16.

As it will mainly be a mobile app, it can be a good idea to support Markdown syntax.

# Road map

Everything is subject to changes as some steps are new to me.

- [x] Base iOS app with screen navigation
- [x] Add some style
- [x] Extand to iPadOS.  
      Tested on iPhone & iPad at the same time.
- [x] Add local storage (SQLite).  
      It will be a backup in case the device can't access CloudKit. I think about FMDB.
- [ ] Use CloudKit to sync data between devices.  
      CK private database
- [ ] Add more note features (checkbox, reminder...)
- [ ] Extand to MacOS
- [ ] Deploy to Beta users
- [ ] Deploy to the App Store
